lfjail: FreeBSD jail management tool
====================================

lfjail is a tool for creating and managing FreeBSD jails.  i wrote lfjail
primarily for my own use, but you're welcome to use it too.

requirements
------------

lfjail requires a C++23 compiler and textproc/libucl from ports.  it is
primarily tested on FreeBSD 15.x, but it will probably work on older
releases.

installing
----------

simply run:

# make [LOCALBASE=/usr/local] [PREFIX=/usr/local] [DESTDIR=/somewhere] install

LOCALBASE is the location of the installed ports.  the default value is
/usr/local.

PREFIX is the prefix under which lfjail will be installed.  the default value
is LOCALBASE.

DESTDIR is the staging directory that files will be installed into, which
might be useful when building a package.
